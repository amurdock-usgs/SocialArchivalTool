Before running:
While this program will run "out of the box" it is recommended that you change the ENCRYPTION_STR variable in the DesEncrypter.java file then recompile before use for added security.
For help in navigating the menus visit the help tab in the program.

To start run the jar file as an executable, start.sh contains the function needed to run the jar using terminal.
To compile unjar the jar file and make updates to the source as needed, the functions used to compile and re-jar can be found in the compile.sh file.
To change how the program runs, edit the values saved in the options.txt file that is generated after the first run.
-This is where you can set to have the program run on a timed update by setting timedUpdate=true and timedUpdateTime=<time>.

If you need assistance with the program or have any questions or suggestions feel free to contact the ngtoc web team at ngtocweb@usgs.gov, any and all feedback is appreciated.
